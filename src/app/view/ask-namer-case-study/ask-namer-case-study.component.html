                When God created Adam, He declared him superior than all of his other creations.
                When angels asked God why He created Adam in the first place, as he could do wrong. God commanded the
                angels
                to tell the names of things.
                They couldn't because they didn't know. God then commanded Adam to tell the names of things, so Adam
                did.

                <br><br>
                That is the abridged version of the story.
                <br><br>

                Nomenclature (the devising or choosing of names for things) is
                the means by which human mind grasps the knowledge of things. Hence, the whole information
                of man, in fact, consists of assigning names for things. Thus, teaching Adam the names of all things was
                meant to impart their knowledge to him.

            Humans have the ability to identify, recognize and label things. It is how we learn.
            To put it simply, all nouns, verbs and adjectives are names that we have assigned.
