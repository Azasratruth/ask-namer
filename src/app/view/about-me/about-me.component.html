        How did a computer scientist become a namer?
      </h3>

      <h4 class="body-avg">
        Bit of a weird story.
        <br><br>
        It began when one of my professors liked my project name in university and since then he has been sending people
        for naming help to me. However, I only committed to it after experimenting with different fields.
        <br><br>
        According to MBTI, I’m an INFJ. Hence, I’m an intuitionist and I find human connection motivating. While MBTI is
        flawed, it still has its merits. A key thing to note is that intuition is convergent thinking while thought (the
        act of thinking) is
        divergent thinking.
        <br><br>
        Naming meets the complete criteria of the type of work that I would find passion in. It requires convergent
        thinking, it has a direct human connection that motivates me, and I find it interesting.
        <br><br>
        Since then, I’ve spent thousands of hours reading research on linguistics and naming.
        And with my naming expertise
        and tech knowledge I have been building a product for brand name diagnosis.

        Other Than Naming
      </h3>

      <h4 class="body-avg">
        Other than naming, I am in product development.

        <br><br>

        I collaborate with <a class="custom-link-no-color text-light" target="_blank" href="https://servedtoday.io"
          fragment="served-today">Served Today</a>, a software house where Ideas
